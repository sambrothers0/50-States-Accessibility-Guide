## 50 States Accessibility Guide

**A website for mapping and displaying accessibility-related information, organized by US state.**

Created by **Group 8** for Professor Schlosser's *Competing Through Business Analytics* class at **William & Mary** in the Master's of Business Analytics program during **Fall 2025**.

The site is deployed live on Render: [Live Site](https://dash-api-final.onrender.com)

## Project Overview

The problem our website seeks to address is the gap in availability of travel information on accessibility. Our goal is to fill this gap with an informative and visually compelling webpage that provides rich accessibility data from live APIs. We've chosen to focus on all US states to be as comprehensive as possible, while still keeping our topic narrow and focused.

**Audience:** Domestic and international tourists, especially those with a physical disability.

We have also included a collection of disability advocacy groups for getting directly involved with the disabled community.

**Value:** This project provides a helpful place for people who are concerned with accessibility to find travel information across the states.

## Technology

The website is created using **Python's Dash** package for single page web applications and **Plotly** for visualization.

---

## Running and Deployment

Although the project is deployed live on Render, it can easily be run locally:

1. Install a recent version of Python.
2. Install the packages listed in `requirements.txt` using a Python installer such as `pip`.
3. After dependencies have been installed, run `app.py` from the root directory.
